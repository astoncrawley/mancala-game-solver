# 💎 Mancala Game Solver

## 📌 Overview
This project analyses solving the board game Mancala. The goal is to explore reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the theoretically optimal action for each player in different states and effectively solve the game. Interactive charts and visualisations are provided to support decision-making.
